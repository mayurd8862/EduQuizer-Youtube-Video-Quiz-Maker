CA: So, in the next half hour or so, we're going to spend some time exploring your vision for what\\nan exciting future might look like, which I guess makes\\nthe first question a little ironic: Why are you boring? EM: Yeah. I ask myself that frequently. We're trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully\\nbe a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion. So right now, one of the most\\nsoul-destroying things is traffic. It affects people\\nin every part of the world. It takes away so much of your life. It's horrible. It's particularly horrible in LA. (Laughter) CA: I think you've brought with you the first visualization\\nthat's been shown of this. Can I show this? EM: Yeah, absolutely.\\nSo this is the first time -- Just to show what we're talking about. So a couple of key things\\nthat are important in having a 3D tunnel network. First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entrance\\nand exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city. So by having an elevator, sort of a car skate,\\nthat's on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance\\nand exits to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces. And then the car gets on a skate. There's no speed limit here, so we're designing this to be able\\nto operate at 200 kilometers an hour. CA: How much? EM: 200 kilometers an hour,\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'zIwLWfaAg-8'}, page_content=\"to operate at 200 kilometers an hour. CA: How much? EM: 200 kilometers an hour,\\nor about 130 miles per hour. So you should be able\\nto get from, say, Westwood to LAX in six minutes -- five, six minutes. (Applause) CA: So possibly, initially done, it's like on a sort\\nof toll road-type basis. EM: Yeah. CA: Which, I guess,\\nalleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well. EM: So, I don't know\\nif people noticed it in the video, but there's no real limit\\nto how many levels of tunnel you can have. You can go much further deep\\nthan you can go up. The deepest mines are much deeper\\nthan the tallest buildings are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrary\\nlevel of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network. This is a very important point. So a key rebuttal to the tunnels\\nis that if you add one layer of tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion,\\nit will get used up, and then you'll be back where you started,\\nback with congestion. But you can go to any\\narbitrary number of tunnels, any number of levels. CA: But people -- seen traditionally,\\nit's incredibly expensive to dig, and that would block this idea. EM: Yeah. Well, they're right. To give you an example,\\nthe LA subway extension, which is -- I think it's\\na two-and-a-half mile extension that was just completed\\nfor two billion dollars. So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile\\nto do the subway extension in LA. And this is not the highest\\nutility subway in the world. So yeah, it's quite difficult\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'zIwLWfaAg-8'}, page_content=\"to do the subway extension in LA. And this is not the highest\\nutility subway in the world. So yeah, it's quite difficult\\nto dig tunnels normally. I think we need to have\\nat least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling. CA: And how could you achieve that? EM: Actually, if you just do two things, you can get to approximately\\nan order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that. So the first thing to do\\nis to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more. So a single road lane tunnel\\naccording to regulations has to be 26 feet,\\nmaybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashes\\nand emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation\\nfor combustion engine cars. But if you shrink that diameter\\nto what we're attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty\\nto get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area\\nby a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scales\\nwith the cross-sectional area. So that's roughly a half-order\\nof magnitude improvement right there. Then tunneling machines currently tunnel\\nfor half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the time\\nis putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall. So if you design the machine instead to do continuous\\ntunneling and reinforcing, that will give you\\na factor of two improvement. Combine that and that's a factor of eight. Also these machines are far from being\\nat their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'zIwLWfaAg-8'}, page_content='at their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power\\nto the machine substantially. I think you can get\\nat least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or five\\nimprovement on top of that. So I think there\\'s a fairly\\nstraightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess\\nof an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile, and our target actually is -- we\\'ve got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail\\nfrom \"South Park,\" I mean, sorry, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\" (Laughter) So Gary is capable of -- currently he\\'s capable\\nof going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine. (Laughter) CA: You want to beat Gary. EM: We want to beat Gary. (Laughter) He\\'s not a patient little fellow, and that will be victory. Victory is beating the snail. CA: But a lot of people imagining,\\ndreaming about future cities, they imagine that actually\\nthe solution is flying cars, drones, etc. You go aboveground. Why isn\\'t that a better solution? You save all that tunneling cost. EM: Right. I\\'m in favor of flying things. Obviously, I do rockets,\\nso I like things that fly. This is not some inherent bias\\nagainst flying things, but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they\\'ll be quite noisy, the wind force generated\\nwill be very high. Let\\'s just say that if something\\'s\\nflying over your head, a whole bunch of flying cars\\ngoing all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.

CA: So you\\'ve got this vision of future cities with these rich,\\n3D networks of tunnels underneath. Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop? Could you apply these tunnels\\nto use for this Hyperloop idea you released a few years ago. EM: Yeah, so we\\'ve been\\nsort of puttering around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. We built a Hyperloop test track\\nadjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage innovative\\nideas in transport. And it actually ends up being\\nthe biggest vacuum chamber in the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume. So it was quite fun to do that,\\nbut it was kind of a hobby thing, and then we think we might -- so we\\'ve built a little pusher car\\nto push the student pods, but we\\'re going to try seeing\\nhow fast we can make the pusher go if it\\'s not pushing something. So we\\'re cautiously optimistic we\\'ll be able to be faster\\nthan the world\\'s fastest bullet train even in a .8-mile stretch. CA: Whoa. Good brakes. EM: Yeah, I mean, it\\'s -- yeah. It\\'s either going to smash\\ninto tiny pieces or go quite fast. CA: But you can picture,\\nthen, a Hyperloop in a tunnel running quite long distances. EM: Exactly.

And looking at tunneling technology, it turns out that\\nin order to make a tunnel, you have to -- In order to seal against the water table, you've got to typically design\\na tunnel wall to be good to about five or six atmospheres. So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, or near-vacuum. So actually, it sort of turns out\\nthat automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enough\\nto resist the water table, it is automatically\\ncapable of holding vacuum. CA: Huh. EM: So, yeah. CA: And so you could actually picture, what kind of length tunnel\\nis in Elon's future to running Hyperloop? EM: I think there's no real length limit. You could dig as much as you want. I think if you were to do something like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop, I think you'd probably want\\nto go underground the entire way because it's a high-density area. You're going under\\na lot of buildings and houses, and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel. Sometimes people think,\\nwell, it's going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house. Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four\\ntunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be able\\nto detect it being dug at all. In fact, if you're able\\nto detect the tunnel being dug, whatever device you are using, you can get a lot of money\\nfor that device from the Israeli military, who is trying to detect\\ntunnels from Hamas, and from the US Customs and Border patrol\"),\n",

It's kind of puttering along,\\nbut it's making good progress, so -- CA: So an even bigger part of your time is being spent on electrifying\\ncars and transport through Tesla. Is one of the motivations\\nfor the tunneling project the realization that actually, in a world where cars are electric\\nand where they're self-driving, there may end up being\\nmore cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now? EM: Yeah, exactly. A lot of people think\\nthat when you make cars autonomous, they'll be able to go faster\\nand that will alleviate congestion.

      "that's on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance\n",

      "an order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that. So the first thing to do\n",
      "is to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more. So a single road lane tunnel\n",
      "according to regulations has to be 26 feet,\n",
      "maybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashes\n",
      "and emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation\n",
      "for combustion engine cars. But if you shrink that diameter\n",
      "to what we're attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty\n",
      "to get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area\n",
      "by a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scales\n",
      "with the cross-sectional area. So that's roughly a half-order\n",
      "of magnitude improvement right there. Then tunneling machines currently tunnel\n",
      "for half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the time\n",
      "is putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall. So if you design the machine instead to do continuous\n",

      "from a helicopter, you would be actually able\n",
      "to look through and see that some of the glass tiles have\n",
      "a solar cell behind them and some do not. You can't tell from street level. CA: You put them in the ones\n",

      "that the cost of the roof plus the cost of electricity -- A solar glass roof will be less\n",

      "like were just talking rubbish, but actually this is toughened glass. Well after the house has collapsed and there's nothing there, the glass tiles will still be there. (Applause) CA: I mean, this is cool. So you're rolling this out\n",
      "in a couple week's time, I think, with four different roofing types. EM: Yeah, we're starting off\n",

      "will be introduced early next year. CA: And what's the scale of ambition here? How many houses do you believe\n",

      "the time scale here to be probably on the order of 40 or 50 years. So on average, a roof\n",
      "is replaced every 20 to 25 years. But you don't start replacing\n",
      "all roofs immediately. But eventually,\n",
      "if you say were to fast-forward to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a roof\n",

      "the economics of solar power, most houses actually have\n",
      "enough sunlight on their roof pretty much to power all of their needs. If you could capture the power, it could pretty much\n",
      "power all their needs. You could go off-grid, kind of. EM: It depends on where you are and what the house size is\n",
      "relative to the roof area, but it's a fair statement to say that most houses in the US\n",
      "have enough roof area to power all the needs of the house. CA: So the key to the economics of the cars, the Semi, of these houses is the falling price\n",

      "a diamond shape overall, and when it's fully done,\n",
      "it'll look like a giant diamond, or that's the idea behind it, and it's aligned on true north. It's a small detail. CA: And capable of producing, eventually, like a hundred gigawatt hours\n",
      "of batteries a year. EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.\n",
      "We think probably more, but yeah. CA: And they're actually\n",
      "being produced right now. EM: They're in production already.\n",
      "CA: You guys put out this video. I mean, is that speeded up? EM: That's the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: How fast does it actually go? EM: Well, when it's running at full speed, you can't actually see the cells\n",

      "does it take to get us there? EM: It's about a hundred, roughly. It's not 10, it's not a thousand. Most likely a hundred. CA: See, I find this amazing. You can picture what it would take to move the world\n",
      "off this vast fossil fuel thing. It's like you're building one, it costs five billion dollars, or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars. Like, it's kind of cool\n",

      "announce another two this year. EM: I think we'll announce locations for somewhere between two\n",

EM: We need to address a global market. CA: OK. (Laughter) This is cool. I think we should talk for -- Actually, global market. I'm going to ask you one question\n",
      "about politics, only one. I'm kind of sick of politics,\n",
      "but I do want to ask you this. You're on a body now\n",
      "giving advice to a guy -- EM: Who? CA: Who has said he doesn't\n",
      "really believe in climate change, and there's a lot of people out there\n",
      "who think you shouldn't be doing that. They'd like you to walk away from that. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think that first of all, I'm just on two advisory councils where the format consists\n",
      "of going around the room and asking people's opinion on things, and so there's like a meeting\n",
      "of going around the room and asking people's opinion on things, and so there's like a meeting\n",
      "every month or two. That's the sum total of my contribution. But I think to the degree\n",
      "that there are people in the room who are arguing in favor\n",
      "of doing something about climate change, or social issues, I've used the meetings I've had thus far to argue in favor of immigration\n",
      "and in favor of climate change. (Applause) And if I hadn't done that, that wasn't on the agenda before. So maybe nothing will happen,\n",
      "but at least the words were said. CA: OK. (Applause) So let's talk SpaceX and Mars. Last time you were here, you spoke about what seemed like\n",
      "a kind of incredibly ambitious dream to develop rockets\n",
      "that were actually reusable. And you've only gone and done it. EM: Finally. It took a long time. CA: Talk us through this.\n",
      "What are we looking at here? EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters coming back from\n",
      "very high and fast in space. So just delivered the upper stage at high velocity. I think this might have been\n",
      "at sort of Mach 7 or so, delivery of the upper stage. (Applause) CA: So that was a sped-up -- EM: That was the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: I thought that was\n",
      "the sped-up version. But I mean, that's amazing, and several of these failed before you finally\n",
      "figured out how to do it, but now you've done this,\n",
      "what, five or six times? EM: We're at eight or nine. CA: And for the first time, you've actually reflown\n",
      "what, five or six times? EM: We're at eight or nine. CA: And for the first time, you've actually reflown\n",
      "one of the rockets that landed. EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster and then prepped it for flight again\n",
      "and flew it again, so it's the first reflight\n",
      "of an orbital booster where that reflight is relevant. So it's important to appreciate\n",
      "that reusability is only relevant if it is rapid and complete. So like an aircraft or a car, the reusability is rapid and complete. You do not send your aircraft\n",
      "to Boeing in-between flights. CA: Right. So this is allowing you\n",
      "to dream of this really ambitious idea of sending many, many, many people to Mars in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess. EM: Yeah. CA: And you've designed\n",
      "this outrageous rocket to do it. Help us understand\n",
      "the scale of this thing. EM: Well, visually\n",
      "you can see that's a person. Yeah, and that's the vehicle. (Laughter) CA: So if that was a skyscraper, that's like, did I read that,\n",
      "a 40-story skyscraper? EM: Probably a little more, yeah. The thrust level of this is really -- This configuration is about four times\n",
      "the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket. CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest\n",
      "rocket humanity ever created before. EM: Yeah. Yeah. CA: As one does.\n",
      "EM: Yeah. (Laughter) In units of 747, a 747 is only about\n",

      "of 120 747s, with all engines blazing. CA: And so even with a machine\n",
      "designed to escape Earth's gravity, I think you told me last time this thing could actually\n",
      "take a fully loaded 747, people, cargo, everything, into orbit. EM: Exactly. This can take\n",
      "a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel, maximum passengers,\n",
      "maximum cargo on the 747 -- this can take it as cargo. CA: So based on this, you presented recently\n",
      "this Interplanetary Transport System which is visualized this way. This is a scene you picture in, what,\n",
      "30 years time? 20 years time? People walking into this rocket. EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of\n",
      "an eight- to 10-year time frame. Aspirationally, that's our target. Our internal targets\n",
      "are more aggressive, but I think -- (Laughter) CA: OK. EM: While vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparison\n",
      "with other rockets, I think the future spacecraft will make this look like a rowboat. The future spaceships\n",
      "will be truly enormous. CA: Why, Elon? Why do we need to build a city on Mars with a million people\n",
      "on it in your lifetime, which I think is kind of\n",
      "what you've said you'd love to do? EM: I think it's important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning\n",
      "and you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we're not out there, if the future does not include\n",
      "being out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it's incredibly depressing if that's not the future\n",

      "to, you know, you pick your issue. And this feels like a distraction. You shouldn't be thinking about this. You should be solving what's here and now. And to be fair, you've done\n",
      "a fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustainable energy. But why not just do that? EM: I think there's -- I look at the future\n",
      "from the standpoint of probabilities. It's like a branching\n",
      "stream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can take\n",
      "that affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing\n",

      "will happen no matter what. If there was no Tesla,\n",
      "if Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity. It's tautological. If you don't have sustainable energy,\n",

      "potentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thing to occur. That's what I consider to be the fundamental\n",

      "this is not inevitable. The sustainable energy future\n",
      "I think is largely inevitable, but being a space-faring civilization\n",
      "is definitely not inevitable. If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 you were able\n",
      "to send somebody to the moon. 1969. Then we had the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle could only\n",
      "take people to low Earth orbit. Then the Space Shuttle retired, and the United States\n",
      "could take no one to orbit. So that's the trend. The trend is like down to nothing. People are mistaken when they think that technology\n",
      "just automatically improves. It does not automatically improve. It only improves if a lot of people\n",

      "listening to you and looking at the different\n",
      "things you've done, that you've got this unique\n",
      "double motivation on everything that I find so interesting. One is this desire to work\n",
