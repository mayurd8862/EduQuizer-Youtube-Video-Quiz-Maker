      "[Document(metadata={'source': 'zIwLWfaAg-8'}, page_content='Chris Anderson:\\nElon, hey, welcome back to TED. It\\'s great to have you here. Elon Musk: Thanks for having me. CA: So, in the next half hour or so, we\\'re going to spend some time exploring your vision for what\\nan exciting future might look like, which I guess makes\\nthe first question a little ironic: Why are you boring? EM: Yeah. I ask myself that frequently. We\\'re trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully\\nbe a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion. So right now, one of the most\\nsoul-destroying things is traffic. It affects people\\nin every part of the world. It takes away so much of your life. It\\'s horrible. It\\'s particularly horrible in LA. (Laughter) CA: I think you\\'ve brought with you the first visualization\\nthat\\'s been shown of this. Can I show this? EM: Yeah, absolutely.\\nSo this is the first time -- Just to show what we\\'re talking about. So a couple of key things\\nthat are important in having a 3D tunnel network. First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entrance\\nand exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city. So by having an elevator, sort of a car skate,\\nthat\\'s on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance\\nand exits to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces. And then the car gets on a skate. There\\'s no speed limit here, so we\\'re designing this to be able\\nto operate at 200 kilometers an hour. CA: How much? EM: 200 kilometers an hour,\\nor about 130 miles per hour. So you should be able\\nto get from, say, Westwood to LAX in six minutes -- five, six minutes. (Applause) CA: So possibly, initially done, it\\'s like on a sort\\nof toll road-type basis. EM: Yeah. CA: Which, I guess,\\nalleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well. EM: So, I don\\'t know\\nif people noticed it in the video, but there\\'s no real limit\\nto how many levels of tunnel you can have. You can go much further deep\\nthan you can go up. The deepest mines are much deeper\\nthan the tallest buildings are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrary\\nlevel of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network. This is a very important point. So a key rebuttal to the tunnels\\nis that if you add one layer of tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion,\\nit will get used up, and then you\\'ll be back where you started,\\nback with congestion. But you can go to any\\narbitrary number of tunnels, any number of levels. CA: But people -- seen traditionally,\\nit\\'s incredibly expensive to dig, and that would block this idea. EM: Yeah. Well, they\\'re right. To give you an example,\\nthe LA subway extension, which is -- I think it\\'s\\na two-and-a-half mile extension that was just completed\\nfor two billion dollars. So it\\'s roughly a billion dollars a mile\\nto do the subway extension in LA. And this is not the highest\\nutility subway in the world. So yeah, it\\'s quite difficult\\nto dig tunnels normally. I think we need to have\\nat least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling. CA: And how could you achieve that? EM: Actually, if you just do two things, you can get to approximately\\nan order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that. So the first thing to do\\nis to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more. So a single road lane tunnel\\naccording to regulations has to be 26 feet,\\nmaybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashes\\nand emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation\\nfor combustion engine cars. But if you shrink that diameter\\nto what we\\'re attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty\\nto get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area\\nby a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scales\\nwith the cross-sectional area. So that\\'s roughly a half-order\\nof magnitude improvement right there. Then tunneling machines currently tunnel\\nfor half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the time\\nis putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall. So if you design the machine instead to do continuous\\ntunneling and reinforcing, that will give you\\na factor of two improvement. Combine that and that\\'s a factor of eight. Also these machines are far from being\\nat their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power\\nto the machine substantially. I think you can get\\nat least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or five\\nimprovement on top of that. So I think there\\'s a fairly\\nstraightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess\\nof an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile, and our target actually is -- we\\'ve got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail\\nfrom \"South Park,\" I mean, sorry, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\" (Laughter) So Gary is capable of -- currently he\\'s capable\\nof going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine. (Laughter) CA: You want to beat Gary. EM: We want to beat Gary. (Laughter) He\\'s not a patient little fellow, and that will be victory. Victory is beating the snail. CA: But a lot of people imagining,\\ndreaming about future cities, they imagine that actually\\nthe solution is flying cars, drones, etc. You go aboveground. Why isn\\'t that a better solution? You save all that tunneling cost. EM: Right. I\\'m in favor of flying things. Obviously, I do rockets,\\nso I like things that fly. This is not some inherent bias\\nagainst flying things, but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they\\'ll be quite noisy, the wind force generated\\nwill be very high. Let\\'s just say that if something\\'s\\nflying over your head, a whole bunch of flying cars\\ngoing all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation. (Laughter) You don\\'t think to yourself,\\n\"Well, I feel better about today.\" You\\'re thinking,\\n\"Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come off\\nand guillotine me?\" Things like that. CA: So you\\'ve got this vision of future cities with these rich,\\n3D networks of tunnels underneath. Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop? Could you apply these tunnels\\nto use for this Hyperloop idea you released a few years ago. EM: Yeah, so we\\'ve been\\nsort of puttering around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. We built a Hyperloop test track\\nadjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage innovative\\nideas in transport. And it actually ends up being\\nthe biggest vacuum chamber in the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume. So it was quite fun to do that,\\nbut it was kind of a hobby thing, and then we think we might -- so we\\'ve built a little pusher car\\nto push the student pods, but we\\'re going to try seeing\\nhow fast we can make the pusher go if it\\'s not pushing something. So we\\'re cautiously optimistic we\\'ll be able to be faster\\nthan the world\\'s fastest bullet train even in a .8-mile stretch. CA: Whoa. Good brakes. EM: Yeah, I mean, it\\'s -- yeah. It\\'s either going to smash\\ninto tiny pieces or go quite fast. CA: But you can picture,\\nthen, a Hyperloop in a tunnel running quite long distances. EM: Exactly. And looking at tunneling technology, it turns out that\\nin order to make a tunnel, you have to -- In order to seal against the water table, you\\'ve got to typically design\\na tunnel wall to be good to about five or six atmospheres. So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, or near-vacuum. So actually, it sort of turns out\\nthat automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enough\\nto resist the water table, it is automatically\\ncapable of holding vacuum. CA: Huh. EM: So, yeah. CA: And so you could actually picture, what kind of length tunnel\\nis in Elon\\'s future to running Hyperloop? EM: I think there\\'s no real length limit. You could dig as much as you want. I think if you were to do something like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop, I think you\\'d probably want\\nto go underground the entire way because it\\'s a high-density area. You\\'re going under\\na lot of buildings and houses, and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel. Sometimes people think,\\nwell, it\\'s going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house. Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four\\ntunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be able\\nto detect it being dug at all. In fact, if you\\'re able\\nto detect the tunnel being dug, whatever device you are using, you can get a lot of money\\nfor that device from the Israeli military, who is trying to detect\\ntunnels from Hamas, and from the US Customs and Border patrol\\nthat try and detect drug tunnels. So the reality is that earth is incredibly good\\nat absorbing vibrations, and once the tunnel depth\\nis below a certain level, it is undetectable. Maybe if you have a very sensitive\\nseismic instrument, you might be able to detect it. CA: So you\\'ve started\\na new company to do this called The Boring Company. Very nice. Very funny. (Laughter) EM: What\\'s funny about that? (Laughter) CA: How much of your time is this? EM: It\\'s maybe ... two or three percent. CA: You\\'ve called it a hobby. This is what an Elon Musk\\nhobby looks like. (Laughter) EM: I mean, it really is, like -- This is basically interns\\nand people doing it part time. We bought some second-hand machinery. It\\'s kind of puttering along,\\nbut it\\'s making good progress, so -- CA: So an even bigger part of your time is being spent on electrifying\\ncars and transport through Tesla. Is one of the motivations\\nfor the tunneling project the realization that actually, in a world where cars are electric\\nand where they\\'re self-driving, there may end up being\\nmore cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now? EM: Yeah, exactly. A lot of people think\\nthat when you make cars autonomous, they\\'ll be able to go faster\\nand that will alleviate congestion. And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomy\\nwhere it\\'s much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point, the affordability of going in a car\\nwill be better than that of a bus. Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket. So the amount of driving that will occur\\nwill be much greater with shared autonomy, and actually traffic will get far worse. CA: You started Tesla\\nwith the goal of persuading the world that electrification\\nwas the future of cars, and a few years ago,\\npeople were laughing at you. Now, not so much. EM: OK. (Laughter) I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. CA: But isn\\'t it true that pretty much\\nevery auto manufacturer has announced\\nserious electrification plans for the short- to medium-term future? EM: Yeah. Yeah. I think almost every automaker\\nhas some electric vehicle program. They vary in seriousness. Some are very serious\\nabout transitioning entirely to electric, and some are just dabbling in it. And some, amazingly,\\nare still pursuing fuel cells, but I think that won\\'t last much longer. CA: But isn\\'t there a sense, though, Elon, where you can now just declare victory\\nand say, you know, \"We did it.\" Let the world electrify,\\nand you go on and focus on other stuff? EM: Yeah. I intend to stay with Tesla\\nas far into the future as I can imagine, and there are a lot of exciting\\nthings that we have coming. Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon. We\\'ll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck. CA: OK, we\\'re going to come to this. So Model 3, it\\'s supposed\\nto be coming in July-ish. EM: Yeah, it\\'s looking quite good\\nfor starting production in July. CA: Wow. One of the things\\nthat people are so excited about is the fact that it\\'s got autopilot. And you put out this video a while back showing what that technology\\nwould look like. EM: Yeah. CA: There\\'s obviously autopilot\\nin Model S right now. What are we seeing here? EM: Yeah, so this is using\\nonly cameras and GPS. So there\\'s no LIDAR\\nor radar being used here. This is just using passive optical,\\nwhich is essentially what a person uses. The whole road system\\nis meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras, and so once you solve cameras or vision, then autonomy is solved. If you don\\'t solve vision,\\nit\\'s not solved. So that\\'s why our focus is\\nso heavily on having a vision neural net that\\'s very effective for road conditions. CA: Right. Many other people\\nare going the LIDAR route. You want cameras plus radar is most of it. EM: You can absolutely\\nbe superhuman with just cameras. Like, you can probably do it\\nten times better than humans would, just cameras. CA: So the new cars being sold right now\\nhave eight cameras in them. They can\\'t yet do what that showed. When will they be able to? EM: I think we\\'re still on track\\nfor being able to go cross-country from LA to New York by the end\\nof the year, fully autonomous. CA: OK, so by the end\\nof the year, you\\'re saying, someone\\'s going to sit in a Tesla\\nwithout touching the steering wheel, tap in \"New York,\" off it goes. EM: Yeah. CA: Won\\'t ever have to touch the wheel --\\nby the end of 2017. EM: Yeah. Essentially,\\nNovember or December of this year, we should be able to go all the way\\nfrom a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any point\\nduring the entire journey. (Applause) CA: Amazing. But part of that is possible because you\\'ve already got a fleet\\nof Teslas driving all these roads. You\\'re accumulating a huge amount\\nof data of that national road system. EM: Yes, but the thing\\nthat will be interesting is that I\\'m actually fairly confident\\nit will be able to do that route even if you change the route dynamically. So, it\\'s fairly easy -- If you say I\\'m going to be really good\\nat one specific route, that\\'s one thing, but it should be able to go,\\nreally be very good, certainly once you enter a highway, to go anywhere on the highway system in a given country. So it\\'s not sort of limited\\nto LA to New York. We could change it\\nand make it Seattle-Florida, that day, in real time. So you were going from LA to New York. Now go from LA to Toronto. CA: So leaving aside\\nregulation for a second, in terms of the technology alone, the time when someone\\nwill be able to buy one of your cars and literally just take the hands\\noff the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they\\'ve arrived, how far away is that, to do that safely? EM: I think that\\'s about two years. So the real trick of it\\nis not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent of the time, because, like, if a car crashes\\none in a thousand times, then you\\'re probably still not going\\nto be comfortable falling asleep. You shouldn\\'t be, certainly. (Laughter) It\\'s never going to be perfect. No system is going to be perfect, but if you say it\\'s perhaps -- the car is unlikely to crash in a hundred lifetimes,\\nor a thousand lifetimes, then people are like, OK, wow,\\nif I were to live a thousand lives, I would still most likely\\nnever experience a crash, then that\\'s probably OK. CA: To sleep. I guess the big concern of yours\\nis that people may actually get seduced too early\\nto think that this is safe, and that you\\'ll have some horrible\\nincident happen that puts things back. EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system\\nis likely to at least mitigate the crash, except in rare circumstances. The thing to appreciate\\nabout vehicle safety is this is probabilistic. I mean, there\\'s some chance that any time\\na human driver gets in a car, that they will have an accident\\nthat is their fault. It\\'s never zero. So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomy\\nneed to be than a person before you can rely on it? CA: But once you get\\nliterally safe hands-off driving, the power to disrupt\\nthe whole industry seems massive, because at that point you\\'ve spoken\\nof people being able to buy a car, drops you off at work,\\nand then you let it go and provide a sort of Uber-like\\nservice to other people, earn you money, maybe even cover the cost\\nof your lease of that car, so you can kind of get a car for free. Is that really likely? EM: Yeah. Absolutely\\nthis is what will happen. So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can choose\\nto use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be used\\nonly by friends and family, only by other drivers\\nwho are rated five star, you can choose to share it sometimes\\nbut not other times. That\\'s 100 percent what will occur. It\\'s just a question of when. CA: Wow. So you mentioned the Semi and I think you\\'re planning\\nto announce this in September, but I\\'m curious whether there\\'s\\nanything you could show us today? EM: I will show you\\na teaser shot of the truck. (Laughter) It\\'s alive. CA: OK. EM: That\\'s definitely a case\\nwhere we want to be cautious about the autonomy features. Yeah. (Laughter) CA: We can\\'t see that much of it, but it doesn\\'t look like\\njust a little friendly neighborhood truck. It looks kind of badass. What sort of semi is this? EM: So this is a heavy duty,\\nlong-range semitruck. So it\\'s the highest weight capability and with long range. So essentially it\\'s meant to alleviate\\nthe heavy-duty trucking loads. And this is something which\\npeople do not today think is possible. They think the truck doesn\\'t have enough\\npower or it doesn\\'t have enough range, and then with the Tesla Semi we want to show that no, an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi. And if you had a tug-of-war competition, the Tesla Semi\\nwill tug the diesel semi uphill. (Laughter) (Applause) CA: That\\'s pretty cool.\\nAnd short term, these aren\\'t driverless. These are going to be trucks\\nthat truck drivers want to drive. EM: Yes. So what will be\\nreally fun about this is you have a flat torque RPM curve\\nwith an electric motor, whereas with a diesel motor or any kind\\nof internal combustion engine car, you\\'ve got a torque RPM curve\\nthat looks like a hill. So this will be a very spry truck. You can drive this\\naround like a sports car. There\\'s no gears.\\nIt\\'s, like, single speed. CA: There\\'s a great movie\\nto be made here somewhere. I don\\'t know what it is\\nand I don\\'t know that it ends well, but it\\'s a great movie. (Laughter) EM: It\\'s quite bizarre test-driving. When I was driving the test prototype\\nfor the first truck. It\\'s really weird,\\nbecause you\\'re driving around and you\\'re just so nimble,\\nand you\\'re in this giant truck. CA: Wait, you\\'ve\\nalready driven a prototype? EM: Yeah, I drove it\\naround the parking lot, and I was like, this is crazy. CA: Wow. This is no vaporware. EM: It\\'s just like,\\ndriving this giant truck and making these mad maneuvers. CA: This is cool.\\nOK, from a really badass picture to a kind of less badass picture. This is just a cute house\\nfrom \"Desperate Housewives\" or something. What on earth is going on here? EM: Well, this illustrates\\nthe picture of the future that I think is how things will evolve. You\\'ve got an electric car\\nin the driveway. If you look in between\\nthe electric car and the house, there are actually three Powerwalls\\nstacked up against the side of the house, and then that house roof is a solar roof. So that\\'s an actual solar glass roof. CA: OK. EM: That\\'s a picture of a real --\\nwell, admittedly, it\\'s a real fake house. That\\'s a real fake house. (Laughter) CA: So these roof tiles, some of them have in them\\nbasically solar power, the ability to -- EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles where you can adjust\\nthe texture and the color to a very fine-grained level, and then there\\'s\\nsort of microlouvers in the glass, such that when you\\'re looking\\nat the roof from street level or close to street level, all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cell\\nbehind it or not. So you have an even color from the ground level. If you were to look at it\\nfrom a helicopter, you would be actually able\\nto look through and see that some of the glass tiles have\\na solar cell behind them and some do not. You can\\'t tell from street level. CA: You put them in the ones\\nthat are likely to see a lot of sun, and that makes these roofs\\nsuper affordable, right? They\\'re not that much more expensive\\nthan just tiling the roof. EM: Yeah. We\\'re very confident\\nthat the cost of the roof plus the cost of electricity -- A solar glass roof will be less\\nthan the cost of a normal roof plus the cost of electricity. So in other words, this will be economically a no-brainer, we think it will look great, and it will last -- We thought about having\\nthe warranty be infinity, but then people thought, well, that might sound\\nlike were just talking rubbish, but actually this is toughened glass. Well after the house has collapsed and there\\'s nothing there, the glass tiles will still be there. (Applause) CA: I mean, this is cool. So you\\'re rolling this out\\nin a couple week\\'s time, I think, with four different roofing types. EM: Yeah, we\\'re starting off\\nwith two, two initially, and the second two\\nwill be introduced early next year. CA: And what\\'s the scale of ambition here? How many houses do you believe\\ncould end up having this type of roofing? EM: I think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof. The thing is to consider\\nthe time scale here to be probably on the order of 40 or 50 years. So on average, a roof\\nis replaced every 20 to 25 years. But you don\\'t start replacing\\nall roofs immediately. But eventually,\\nif you say were to fast-forward to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a roof\\nthat does not have solar. CA: Is there a mental model thing\\nthat people don\\'t get here that because of the shift in the cost,\\nthe economics of solar power, most houses actually have\\nenough sunlight on their roof pretty much to power all of their needs. If you could capture the power, it could pretty much\\npower all their needs. You could go off-grid, kind of. EM: It depends on where you are and what the house size is\\nrelative to the roof area, but it\\'s a fair statement to say that most houses in the US\\nhave enough roof area to power all the needs of the house. CA: So the key to the economics of the cars, the Semi, of these houses is the falling price\\nof lithium-ion batteries, which you\\'ve made a huge bet on as Tesla. In many ways, that\\'s almost\\nthe core competency. And you\\'ve decided that to really, like, own that competency, you just have to build\\nthe world\\'s largest manufacturing plant to double the world\\'s supply\\nof lithium-ion batteries, with this guy. What is this? EM: Yeah, so that\\'s the Gigafactory, progress so far on the Gigafactory. Eventually, you can sort of roughly see that there\\'s sort of\\na diamond shape overall, and when it\\'s fully done,\\nit\\'ll look like a giant diamond, or that\\'s the idea behind it, and it\\'s aligned on true north. It\\'s a small detail. CA: And capable of producing, eventually, like a hundred gigawatt hours\\nof batteries a year. EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.\\nWe think probably more, but yeah. CA: And they\\'re actually\\nbeing produced right now. EM: They\\'re in production already.\\nCA: You guys put out this video. I mean, is that speeded up? EM: That\\'s the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: How fast does it actually go? EM: Well, when it\\'s running at full speed, you can\\'t actually see the cells\\nwithout a strobe light. It\\'s just blur. (Laughter) CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,\\nabout what makes an exciting future is a future where we no longer\\nfeel guilty about energy. Help us picture this. How many Gigafactories, if you like,\\ndoes it take to get us there? EM: It\\'s about a hundred, roughly. It\\'s not 10, it\\'s not a thousand. Most likely a hundred. CA: See, I find this amazing. You can picture what it would take to move the world\\noff this vast fossil fuel thing. It\\'s like you\\'re building one, it costs five billion dollars, or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars. Like, it\\'s kind of cool\\nthat you can picture that project. And you\\'re planning to do, at Tesla --\\nannounce another two this year. EM: I think we\\'ll announce locations for somewhere between two\\nand four Gigafactories later this year. Yeah, probably four. CA: Whoa. (Applause) No more teasing from you for here? Like -- where, continent? You can say no. EM: We need to address a global market. CA: OK. (Laughter) This is cool. I think we should talk for -- Actually, global market. I\\'m going to ask you one question\\nabout politics, only one. I\\'m kind of sick of politics,\\nbut I do want to ask you this. You\\'re on a body now\\ngiving advice to a guy -- EM: Who? CA: Who has said he doesn\\'t\\nreally believe in climate change, and there\\'s a lot of people out there\\nwho think you shouldn\\'t be doing that. They\\'d like you to walk away from that. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think that first of all, I\\'m just on two advisory councils where the format consists\\nof going around the room and asking people\\'s opinion on things, and so there\\'s like a meeting\\nevery month or two. That\\'s the sum total of my contribution. But I think to the degree\\nthat there are people in the room who are arguing in favor\\nof doing something about climate change, or social issues, I\\'ve used the meetings I\\'ve had thus far to argue in favor of immigration\\nand in favor of climate change. (Applause) And if I hadn\\'t done that, that wasn\\'t on the agenda before. So maybe nothing will happen,\\nbut at least the words were said. CA: OK. (Applause) So let\\'s talk SpaceX and Mars. Last time you were here, you spoke about what seemed like\\na kind of incredibly ambitious dream to develop rockets\\nthat were actually reusable. And you\\'ve only gone and done it. EM: Finally. It took a long time. CA: Talk us through this.\\nWhat are we looking at here? EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters coming back from\\nvery high and fast in space. So just delivered the upper stage at high velocity. I think this might have been\\nat sort of Mach 7 or so, delivery of the upper stage. (Applause) CA: So that was a sped-up -- EM: That was the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: I thought that was\\nthe sped-up version. But I mean, that\\'s amazing, and several of these failed before you finally\\nfigured out how to do it, but now you\\'ve done this,\\nwhat, five or six times? EM: We\\'re at eight or nine. CA: And for the first time, you\\'ve actually reflown\\none of the rockets that landed. EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster and then prepped it for flight again\\nand flew it again, so it\\'s the first reflight\\nof an orbital booster where that reflight is relevant. So it\\'s important to appreciate\\nthat reusability is only relevant if it is rapid and complete. So like an aircraft or a car, the reusability is rapid and complete. You do not send your aircraft\\nto Boeing in-between flights. CA: Right. So this is allowing you\\nto dream of this really ambitious idea of sending many, many, many people to Mars in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess. EM: Yeah. CA: And you\\'ve designed\\nthis outrageous rocket to do it. Help us understand\\nthe scale of this thing. EM: Well, visually\\nyou can see that\\'s a person. Yeah, and that\\'s the vehicle. (Laughter) CA: So if that was a skyscraper, that\\'s like, did I read that,\\na 40-story skyscraper? EM: Probably a little more, yeah. The thrust level of this is really -- This configuration is about four times\\nthe thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket. CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest\\nrocket humanity ever created before. EM: Yeah. Yeah. CA: As one does.\\nEM: Yeah. (Laughter) In units of 747, a 747 is only about\\na quarter of a million pounds of thrust, so for every 10 million pounds of thrust, there\\'s 40 747s. So this would be the thrust equivalent\\nof 120 747s, with all engines blazing. CA: And so even with a machine\\ndesigned to escape Earth\\'s gravity, I think you told me last time this thing could actually\\ntake a fully loaded 747, people, cargo, everything, into orbit. EM: Exactly. This can take\\na fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel, maximum passengers,\\nmaximum cargo on the 747 -- this can take it as cargo. CA: So based on this, you presented recently\\nthis Interplanetary Transport System which is visualized this way. This is a scene you picture in, what,\\n30 years time? 20 years time? People walking into this rocket. EM: I\\'m hopeful it\\'s sort of\\nan eight- to 10-year time frame. Aspirationally, that\\'s our target. Our internal targets\\nare more aggressive, but I think -- (Laughter) CA: OK. EM: While vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparison\\nwith other rockets, I think the future spacecraft will make this look like a rowboat. The future spaceships\\nwill be truly enormous. CA: Why, Elon? Why do we need to build a city on Mars with a million people\\non it in your lifetime, which I think is kind of\\nwhat you\\'ve said you\\'d love to do? EM: I think it\\'s important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning\\nand you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What\\'s the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we\\'re not out there, if the future does not include\\nbeing out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it\\'s incredibly depressing if that\\'s not the future\\nthat we\\'re going to have. (Applause) CA: People want to position this\\nas an either or, that there are so many desperate things\\nhappening on the planet now from climate to poverty\\nto, you know, you pick your issue. And this feels like a distraction. You shouldn\\'t be thinking about this. You should be solving what\\'s here and now. And to be fair, you\\'ve done\\na fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustainable energy. But why not just do that? EM: I think there\\'s -- I look at the future\\nfrom the standpoint of probabilities. It\\'s like a branching\\nstream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can take\\nthat affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing\\nor slow down another thing. I may introduce something new\\nto the probability stream. Sustainable energy\\nwill happen no matter what. If there was no Tesla,\\nif Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity. It\\'s tautological. If you don\\'t have sustainable energy,\\nit means you have unsustainable energy. Eventually you will run out, and the laws of economics\\nwill drive civilization towards sustainable energy, inevitably. The fundamental value\\nof a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates\\nthe advent of sustainable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur. So when I think, like, what is the fundamental good\\nof a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade,\\npotentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thing to occur. That\\'s what I consider to be the fundamental\\naspirational good of Tesla. Then there\\'s becoming a multiplanet\\nspecies and space-faring civilization. This is not inevitable. It\\'s very important to appreciate\\nthis is not inevitable. The sustainable energy future\\nI think is largely inevitable, but being a space-faring civilization\\nis definitely not inevitable. If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 you were able\\nto send somebody to the moon. 1969. Then we had the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle could only\\ntake people to low Earth orbit. Then the Space Shuttle retired, and the United States\\ncould take no one to orbit. So that\\'s the trend. The trend is like down to nothing. People are mistaken when they think that technology\\njust automatically improves. It does not automatically improve. It only improves if a lot of people\\nwork very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think,\\nby itself degrade, actually. You look at great civilizations\\nlike Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that. And then the Romans,\\nthey built these incredible aqueducts. They forgot how to do it. CA: Elon, it almost seems,\\nlistening to you and looking at the different\\nthings you\\'ve done, that you\\'ve got this unique\\ndouble motivation on everything that I find so interesting. One is this desire to work\\nfor humanity\\'s long-term good. The other is the desire\\nto do something exciting. And often it feels like you feel\\nlike you need the one to drive the other. With Tesla, you want\\nto have sustainable energy, so you made these super sexy,\\nexciting cars to do it. Solar energy, we need to get there, so we need to make these beautiful roofs. We haven\\'t even spoken\\nabout your newest thing, which we don\\'t have time to do, but you want to save humanity from bad AI, and so you\\'re going to create\\nthis really cool brain-machine interface to give us all infinite memory\\nand telepathy and so forth. And on Mars, it feels\\nlike what you\\'re saying is, yeah, we need to save humanity and have a backup plan, but also we need to inspire humanity, and this is a way to inspire. EM: I think the value\\nof beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear. I\\'m not trying to be anyone\\'s savior. That is not the -- I\\'m just trying to think about the future and not be sad. (Applause) CA: Beautiful statement. I think everyone here would agree that it is not -- None of this is going\\nto happen inevitably. The fact that in your mind,\\nyou dream this stuff, you dream stuff that no one else\\nwould dare dream, or no one else\\nwould be capable of dreaming at the level of complexity that you do. The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,\\nis a really remarkable thing. Thank you for helping us all\\nto dream a bit bigger. EM: But you\\'ll tell me if it ever\\nstarts getting genuinely insane, right? (Laughter) CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.\\nThat was really, really fantastic. That was really fantastic. (Applause)')]\n"

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'zIwLWfaAg-8'}, page_content='Chris Anderson:\\nElon, hey, welcome back to TED. It\\'s great to have you here. Elon Musk: Thanks for having me. CA: So, in the next half hour or so, we\\'re going to spend some time exploring your vision for what\\nan exciting future might look like, which I guess makes\\nthe first question a little ironic: Why are you boring? EM: Yeah. I ask myself that frequently. We\\'re trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully\\nbe a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion. So right now, one of the most\\nsoul-destroying things is traffic. It affects people\\nin every part of the world. It takes away so much of your life. It\\'s horrible. It\\'s particularly horrible in LA. (Laughter) CA: I think you\\'ve brought with you the first visualization\\nthat\\'s been shown of this. Can I show this? EM: Yeah, absolutely.\\nSo this is the first time -- Just to show what we\\'re talking about. So a couple of key things\\nthat are important in having a 3D tunnel network. First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entrance\\nand exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city. So by having an elevator, sort of a car skate,\\nthat\\'s on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance\\nand exits to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces. And then the car gets on a skate. There\\'s no speed limit here, so we\\'re designing this to be able\\nto operate at 200 kilometers an hour. CA: How much? EM: 200 kilometers an hour,\\nor about 130 miles per hour. So you should be able\\nto get from, say, Westwood to LAX in six minutes -- five, six minutes. (Applause) CA: So possibly, initially done, it\\'s like on a sort\\nof toll road-type basis. EM: Yeah. CA: Which, I guess,\\nalleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well. EM: So, I don\\'t know\\nif people noticed it in the video, but there\\'s no real limit\\nto how many levels of tunnel you can have. You can go much further deep\\nthan you can go up. The deepest mines are much deeper\\nthan the tallest buildings are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrary\\nlevel of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network. This is a very important point. So a key rebuttal to the tunnels\\nis that if you add one layer of tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion,\\nit will get used up, and then you\\'ll be back where you started,\\nback with congestion. But you can go to any\\narbitrary number of tunnels, any number of levels. CA: But people -- seen traditionally,\\nit\\'s incredibly expensive to dig, and that would block this idea. EM: Yeah. Well, they\\'re right. To give you an example,\\nthe LA subway extension, which is -- I think it\\'s\\na two-and-a-half mile extension that was just completed\\nfor two billion dollars. So it\\'s roughly a billion dollars a mile\\nto do the subway extension in LA. And this is not the highest\\nutility subway in the world. So yeah, it\\'s quite difficult\\nto dig tunnels normally. I think we need to have\\nat least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling. CA: And how could you achieve that? EM: Actually, if you just do two things, you can get to approximately\\nan order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that. So the first thing to do\\nis to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more. So a single road lane tunnel\\naccording to regulations has to be 26 feet,\\nmaybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashes\\nand emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation\\nfor combustion engine cars. But if you shrink that diameter\\nto what we\\'re attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty\\nto get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area\\nby a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scales\\nwith the cross-sectional area. So that\\'s roughly a half-order\\nof magnitude improvement right there. Then tunneling machines currently tunnel\\nfor half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the time\\nis putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall. So if you design the machine instead to do continuous\\ntunneling and reinforcing, that will give you\\na factor of two improvement. Combine that and that\\'s a factor of eight. Also these machines are far from being\\nat their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power\\nto the machine substantially. I think you can get\\nat least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or five\\nimprovement on top of that. So I think there\\'s a fairly\\nstraightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess\\nof an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile, and our target actually is -- we\\'ve got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail\\nfrom \"South Park,\" I mean, sorry, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\" (Laughter) So Gary is capable of -- currently he\\'s capable\\nof going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine. (Laughter) CA: You want to beat Gary. EM: We want to beat Gary. (Laughter) He\\'s not a patient little fellow, and that will be victory. Victory is beating the snail. CA: But a lot of people imagining,\\ndreaming about future cities, they imagine that actually\\nthe solution is flying cars, drones, etc. You go aboveground. Why isn\\'t that a better solution? You save all that tunneling cost. EM: Right. I\\'m in favor of flying things. Obviously, I do rockets,\\nso I like things that fly. This is not some inherent bias\\nagainst flying things, but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they\\'ll be quite noisy, the wind force generated\\nwill be very high. Let\\'s just say that if something\\'s\\nflying over your head, a whole bunch of flying cars\\ngoing all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation. (Laughter) You don\\'t think to yourself,\\n\"Well, I feel better about today.\" You\\'re thinking,\\n\"Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come off\\nand guillotine me?\" Things like that. CA: So you\\'ve got this vision of future cities with these rich,\\n3D networks of tunnels underneath. Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop? Could you apply these tunnels\\nto use for this Hyperloop idea you released a few years ago. EM: Yeah, so we\\'ve been\\nsort of puttering around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. We built a Hyperloop test track\\nadjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage innovative\\nideas in transport. And it actually ends up being\\nthe biggest vacuum chamber in the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume. So it was quite fun to do that,\\nbut it was kind of a hobby thing, and then we think we might -- so we\\'ve built a little pusher car\\nto push the student pods, but we\\'re going to try seeing\\nhow fast we can make the pusher go if it\\'s not pushing something. So we\\'re cautiously optimistic we\\'ll be able to be faster\\nthan the world\\'s fastest bullet train even in a .8-mile stretch. CA: Whoa. Good brakes. EM: Yeah, I mean, it\\'s -- yeah. It\\'s either going to smash\\ninto tiny pieces or go quite fast. CA: But you can picture,\\nthen, a Hyperloop in a tunnel running quite long distances. EM: Exactly. And looking at tunneling technology, it turns out that\\nin order to make a tunnel, you have to -- In order to seal against the water table, you\\'ve got to typically design\\na tunnel wall to be good to about five or six atmospheres. So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, or near-vacuum. So actually, it sort of turns out\\nthat automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enough\\nto resist the water table, it is automatically\\ncapable of holding vacuum. CA: Huh. EM: So, yeah. CA: And so you could actually picture, what kind of length tunnel\\nis in Elon\\'s future to running Hyperloop? EM: I think there\\'s no real length limit. You could dig as much as you want. I think if you were to do something like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop, I think you\\'d probably want\\nto go underground the entire way because it\\'s a high-density area. You\\'re going under\\na lot of buildings and houses, and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel. Sometimes people think,\\nwell, it\\'s going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house. Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four\\ntunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be able\\nto detect it being dug at all. In fact, if you\\'re able\\nto detect the tunnel being dug, whatever device you are using, you can get a lot of money\\nfor that device from the Israeli military, who is trying to detect\\ntunnels from Hamas, and from the US Customs and Border patrol\\nthat try and detect drug tunnels. So the reality is that earth is incredibly good\\nat absorbing vibrations, and once the tunnel depth\\nis below a certain level, it is undetectable. Maybe if you have a very sensitive\\nseismic instrument, you might be able to detect it. CA: So you\\'ve started\\na new company to do this called The Boring Company. Very nice. Very funny. (Laughter) EM: What\\'s funny about that? (Laughter) CA: How much of your time is this? EM: It\\'s maybe ... two or three percent. CA: You\\'ve called it a hobby. This is what an Elon Musk\\nhobby looks like. (Laughter) EM: I mean, it really is, like -- This is basically interns\\nand people doing it part time. We bought some second-hand machinery. It\\'s kind of puttering along,\\nbut it\\'s making good progress, so -- CA: So an even bigger part of your time is being spent on electrifying\\ncars and transport through Tesla. Is one of the motivations\\nfor the tunneling project the realization that actually, in a world where cars are electric\\nand where they\\'re self-driving, there may end up being\\nmore cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now? EM: Yeah, exactly. A lot of people think\\nthat when you make cars autonomous, they\\'ll be able to go faster\\nand that will alleviate congestion. And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomy\\nwhere it\\'s much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point, the affordability of going in a car\\nwill be better than that of a bus. Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket. So the amount of driving that will occur\\nwill be much greater with shared autonomy, and actually traffic will get far worse. CA: You started Tesla\\nwith the goal of persuading the world that electrification\\nwas the future of cars, and a few years ago,\\npeople were laughing at you. Now, not so much. EM: OK. (Laughter) I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. CA: But isn\\'t it true that pretty much\\nevery auto manufacturer has announced\\nserious electrification plans for the short- to medium-term future? EM: Yeah. Yeah. I think almost every automaker\\nhas some electric vehicle program. They vary in seriousness. Some are very serious\\nabout transitioning entirely to electric, and some are just dabbling in it. And some, amazingly,\\nare still pursuing fuel cells, but I think that won\\'t last much longer. CA: But isn\\'t there a sense, though, Elon, where you can now just declare victory\\nand say, you know, \"We did it.\" Let the world electrify,\\nand you go on and focus on other stuff? EM: Yeah. I intend to stay with Tesla\\nas far into the future as I can imagine, and there are a lot of exciting\\nthings that we have coming. Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon. We\\'ll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck. CA: OK, we\\'re going to come to this. So Model 3, it\\'s supposed\\nto be coming in July-ish. EM: Yeah, it\\'s looking quite good\\nfor starting production in July. CA: Wow. One of the things\\nthat people are so excited about is the fact that it\\'s got autopilot. And you put out this video a while back showing what that technology\\nwould look like. EM: Yeah. CA: There\\'s obviously autopilot\\nin Model S right now. What are we seeing here? EM: Yeah, so this is using\\nonly cameras and GPS. So there\\'s no LIDAR\\nor radar being used here. This is just using passive optical,\\nwhich is essentially what a person uses. The whole road system\\nis meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras, and so once you solve cameras or vision, then autonomy is solved. If you don\\'t solve vision,\\nit\\'s not solved. So that\\'s why our focus is\\nso heavily on having a vision neural net that\\'s very effective for road conditions. CA: Right. Many other people\\nare going the LIDAR route. You want cameras plus radar is most of it. EM: You can absolutely\\nbe superhuman with just cameras. Like, you can probably do it\\nten times better than humans would, just cameras. CA: So the new cars being sold right now\\nhave eight cameras in them. They can\\'t yet do what that showed. When will they be able to? EM: I think we\\'re still on track\\nfor being able to go cross-country from LA to New York by the end\\nof the year, fully autonomous. CA: OK, so by the end\\nof the year, you\\'re saying, someone\\'s going to sit in a Tesla\\nwithout touching the steering wheel, tap in \"New York,\" off it goes. EM: Yeah. CA: Won\\'t ever have to touch the wheel --\\nby the end of 2017. EM: Yeah. Essentially,\\nNovember or December of this year, we should be able to go all the way\\nfrom a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any point\\nduring the entire journey. (Applause) CA: Amazing. But part of that is possible because you\\'ve already got a fleet\\nof Teslas driving all these roads. You\\'re accumulating a huge amount\\nof data of that national road system. EM: Yes, but the thing\\nthat will be interesting is that I\\'m actually fairly confident\\nit will be able to do that route even if you change the route dynamically. So, it\\'s fairly easy -- If you say I\\'m going to be really good\\nat one specific route, that\\'s one thing, but it should be able to go,\\nreally be very good, certainly once you enter a highway, to go anywhere on the highway system in a given country. So it\\'s not sort of limited\\nto LA to New York. We could change it\\nand make it Seattle-Florida, that day, in real time. So you were going from LA to New York. Now go from LA to Toronto. CA: So leaving aside\\nregulation for a second, in terms of the technology alone, the time when someone\\nwill be able to buy one of your cars and literally just take the hands\\noff the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they\\'ve arrived, how far away is that, to do that safely? EM: I think that\\'s about two years. So the real trick of it\\nis not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent of the time, because, like, if a car crashes\\none in a thousand times, then you\\'re probably still not going\\nto be comfortable falling asleep. You shouldn\\'t be, certainly. (Laughter) It\\'s never going to be perfect. No system is going to be perfect, but if you say it\\'s perhaps -- the car is unlikely to crash in a hundred lifetimes,\\nor a thousand lifetimes, then people are like, OK, wow,\\nif I were to live a thousand lives, I would still most likely\\nnever experience a crash, then that\\'s probably OK. CA: To sleep. I guess the big concern of yours\\nis that people may actually get seduced too early\\nto think that this is safe, and that you\\'ll have some horrible\\nincident happen that puts things back. EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system\\nis likely to at least mitigate the crash, except in rare circumstances. The thing to appreciate\\nabout vehicle safety is this is probabilistic. I mean, there\\'s some chance that any time\\na human driver gets in a car, that they will have an accident\\nthat is their fault. It\\'s never zero. So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomy\\nneed to be than a person before you can rely on it? CA: But once you get\\nliterally safe hands-off driving, the power to disrupt\\nthe whole industry seems massive, because at that point you\\'ve spoken\\nof people being able to buy a car, drops you off at work,\\nand then you let it go and provide a sort of Uber-like\\nservice to other people, earn you money, maybe even cover the cost\\nof your lease of that car, so you can kind of get a car for free. Is that really likely? EM: Yeah. Absolutely\\nthis is what will happen. So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can choose\\nto use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be used\\nonly by friends and family, only by other drivers\\nwho are rated five star, you can choose to share it sometimes\\nbut not other times. That\\'s 100 percent what will occur. It\\'s just a question of when. CA: Wow. So you mentioned the Semi and I think you\\'re planning\\nto announce this in September, but I\\'m curious whether there\\'s\\nanything you could show us today? EM: I will show you\\na teaser shot of the truck. (Laughter) It\\'s alive. CA: OK. EM: That\\'s definitely a case\\nwhere we want to be cautious about the autonomy features. Yeah. (Laughter) CA: We can\\'t see that much of it, but it doesn\\'t look like\\njust a little friendly neighborhood truck. It looks kind of badass. What sort of semi is this? EM: So this is a heavy duty,\\nlong-range semitruck. So it\\'s the highest weight capability and with long range. So essentially it\\'s meant to alleviate\\nthe heavy-duty trucking loads. And this is something which\\npeople do not today think is possible. They think the truck doesn\\'t have enough\\npower or it doesn\\'t have enough range, and then with the Tesla Semi we want to show that no, an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi. And if you had a tug-of-war competition, the Tesla Semi\\nwill tug the diesel semi uphill. (Laughter) (Applause) CA: That\\'s pretty cool.\\nAnd short term, these aren\\'t driverless. These are going to be trucks\\nthat truck drivers want to drive. EM: Yes. So what will be\\nreally fun about this is you have a flat torque RPM curve\\nwith an electric motor, whereas with a diesel motor or any kind\\nof internal combustion engine car, you\\'ve got a torque RPM curve\\nthat looks like a hill. So this will be a very spry truck. You can drive this\\naround like a sports car. There\\'s no gears.\\nIt\\'s, like, single speed. CA: There\\'s a great movie\\nto be made here somewhere. I don\\'t know what it is\\nand I don\\'t know that it ends well, but it\\'s a great movie. (Laughter) EM: It\\'s quite bizarre test-driving. When I was driving the test prototype\\nfor the first truck. It\\'s really weird,\\nbecause you\\'re driving around and you\\'re just so nimble,\\nand you\\'re in this giant truck. CA: Wait, you\\'ve\\nalready driven a prototype? EM: Yeah, I drove it\\naround the parking lot, and I was like, this is crazy. CA: Wow. This is no vaporware. EM: It\\'s just like,\\ndriving this giant truck and making these mad maneuvers. CA: This is cool.\\nOK, from a really badass picture to a kind of less badass picture. This is just a cute house\\nfrom \"Desperate Housewives\" or something. What on earth is going on here? EM: Well, this illustrates\\nthe picture of the future that I think is how things will evolve. You\\'ve got an electric car\\nin the driveway. If you look in between\\nthe electric car and the house, there are actually three Powerwalls\\nstacked up against the side of the house, and then that house roof is a solar roof. So that\\'s an actual solar glass roof. CA: OK. EM: That\\'s a picture of a real --\\nwell, admittedly, it\\'s a real fake house. That\\'s a real fake house. (Laughter) CA: So these roof tiles, some of them have in them\\nbasically solar power, the ability to -- EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles where you can adjust\\nthe texture and the color to a very fine-grained level, and then there\\'s\\nsort of microlouvers in the glass, such that when you\\'re looking\\nat the roof from street level or close to street level, all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cell\\nbehind it or not. So you have an even color from the ground level. If you were to look at it\\nfrom a helicopter, you would be actually able\\nto look through and see that some of the glass tiles have\\na solar cell behind them and some do not. You can\\'t tell from street level. CA: You put them in the ones\\nthat are likely to see a lot of sun, and that makes these roofs\\nsuper affordable, right? They\\'re not that much more expensive\\nthan just tiling the roof. EM: Yeah. We\\'re very confident\\nthat the cost of the roof plus the cost of electricity -- A solar glass roof will be less\\nthan the cost of a normal roof plus the cost of electricity. So in other words, this will be economically a no-brainer, we think it will look great, and it will last -- We thought about having\\nthe warranty be infinity, but then people thought, well, that might sound\\nlike were just talking rubbish, but actually this is toughened glass. Well after the house has collapsed and there\\'s nothing there, the glass tiles will still be there. (Applause) CA: I mean, this is cool. So you\\'re rolling this out\\nin a couple week\\'s time, I think, with four different roofing types. EM: Yeah, we\\'re starting off\\nwith two, two initially, and the second two\\nwill be introduced early next year. CA: And what\\'s the scale of ambition here? How many houses do you believe\\ncould end up having this type of roofing? EM: I think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof. The thing is to consider\\nthe time scale here to be probably on the order of 40 or 50 years. So on average, a roof\\nis replaced every 20 to 25 years. But you don\\'t start replacing\\nall roofs immediately. But eventually,\\nif you say were to fast-forward to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a roof\\nthat does not have solar. CA: Is there a mental model thing\\nthat people don\\'t get here that because of the shift in the cost,\\nthe economics of solar power, most houses actually have\\nenough sunlight on their roof pretty much to power all of their needs. If you could capture the power, it could pretty much\\npower all their needs. You could go off-grid, kind of. EM: It depends on where you are and what the house size is\\nrelative to the roof area, but it\\'s a fair statement to say that most houses in the US\\nhave enough roof area to power all the needs of the house. CA: So the key to the economics of the cars, the Semi, of these houses is the falling price\\nof lithium-ion batteries, which you\\'ve made a huge bet on as Tesla. In many ways, that\\'s almost\\nthe core competency. And you\\'ve decided that to really, like, own that competency, you just have to build\\nthe world\\'s largest manufacturing plant to double the world\\'s supply\\nof lithium-ion batteries, with this guy. What is this? EM: Yeah, so that\\'s the Gigafactory, progress so far on the Gigafactory. Eventually, you can sort of roughly see that there\\'s sort of\\na diamond shape overall, and when it\\'s fully done,\\nit\\'ll look like a giant diamond, or that\\'s the idea behind it, and it\\'s aligned on true north. It\\'s a small detail. CA: And capable of producing, eventually, like a hundred gigawatt hours\\nof batteries a year. EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.\\nWe think probably more, but yeah. CA: And they\\'re actually\\nbeing produced right now. EM: They\\'re in production already.\\nCA: You guys put out this video. I mean, is that speeded up? EM: That\\'s the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: How fast does it actually go? EM: Well, when it\\'s running at full speed, you can\\'t actually see the cells\\nwithout a strobe light. It\\'s just blur. (Laughter) CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,\\nabout what makes an exciting future is a future where we no longer\\nfeel guilty about energy. Help us picture this. How many Gigafactories, if you like,\\ndoes it take to get us there? EM: It\\'s about a hundred, roughly. It\\'s not 10, it\\'s not a thousand. Most likely a hundred. CA: See, I find this amazing. You can picture what it would take to move the world\\noff this vast fossil fuel thing. It\\'s like you\\'re building one, it costs five billion dollars, or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars. Like, it\\'s kind of cool\\nthat you can picture that project. And you\\'re planning to do, at Tesla --\\nannounce another two this year. EM: I think we\\'ll announce locations for somewhere between two\\nand four Gigafactories later this year. Yeah, probably four. CA: Whoa. (Applause) No more teasing from you for here? Like -- where, continent? You can say no. EM: We need to address a global market. CA: OK. (Laughter) This is cool. I think we should talk for -- Actually, global market. I\\'m going to ask you one question\\nabout politics, only one. I\\'m kind of sick of politics,\\nbut I do want to ask you this. You\\'re on a body now\\ngiving advice to a guy -- EM: Who? CA: Who has said he doesn\\'t\\nreally believe in climate change, and there\\'s a lot of people out there\\nwho think you shouldn\\'t be doing that. They\\'d like you to walk away from that. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think that first of all, I\\'m just on two advisory councils where the format consists\\nof going around the room and asking people\\'s opinion on things, and so there\\'s like a meeting\\nevery month or two. That\\'s the sum total of my contribution. But I think to the degree\\nthat there are people in the room who are arguing in favor\\nof doing something about climate change, or social issues, I\\'ve used the meetings I\\'ve had thus far to argue in favor of immigration\\nand in favor of climate change. (Applause) And if I hadn\\'t done that, that wasn\\'t on the agenda before. So maybe nothing will happen,\\nbut at least the words were said. CA: OK. (Applause) So let\\'s talk SpaceX and Mars. Last time you were here, you spoke about what seemed like\\na kind of incredibly ambitious dream to develop rockets\\nthat were actually reusable. And you\\'ve only gone and done it. EM: Finally. It took a long time. CA: Talk us through this.\\nWhat are we looking at here? EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters coming back from\\nvery high and fast in space. So just delivered the upper stage at high velocity. I think this might have been\\nat sort of Mach 7 or so, delivery of the upper stage. (Applause) CA: So that was a sped-up -- EM: That was the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: I thought that was\\nthe sped-up version. But I mean, that\\'s amazing, and several of these failed before you finally\\nfigured out how to do it, but now you\\'ve done this,\\nwhat, five or six times? EM: We\\'re at eight or nine. CA: And for the first time, you\\'ve actually reflown\\none of the rockets that landed. EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster and then prepped it for flight again\\nand flew it again, so it\\'s the first reflight\\nof an orbital booster where that reflight is relevant. So it\\'s important to appreciate\\nthat reusability is only relevant if it is rapid and complete. So like an aircraft or a car, the reusability is rapid and complete. You do not send your aircraft\\nto Boeing in-between flights. CA: Right. So this is allowing you\\nto dream of this really ambitious idea of sending many, many, many people to Mars in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess. EM: Yeah. CA: And you\\'ve designed\\nthis outrageous rocket to do it. Help us understand\\nthe scale of this thing. EM: Well, visually\\nyou can see that\\'s a person. Yeah, and that\\'s the vehicle. (Laughter) CA: So if that was a skyscraper, that\\'s like, did I read that,\\na 40-story skyscraper? EM: Probably a little more, yeah. The thrust level of this is really -- This configuration is about four times\\nthe thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket. CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest\\nrocket humanity ever created before. EM: Yeah. Yeah. CA: As one does.\\nEM: Yeah. (Laughter) In units of 747, a 747 is only about\\na quarter of a million pounds of thrust, so for every 10 million pounds of thrust, there\\'s 40 747s. So this would be the thrust equivalent\\nof 120 747s, with all engines blazing. CA: And so even with a machine\\ndesigned to escape Earth\\'s gravity, I think you told me last time this thing could actually\\ntake a fully loaded 747, people, cargo, everything, into orbit. EM: Exactly. This can take\\na fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel, maximum passengers,\\nmaximum cargo on the 747 -- this can take it as cargo. CA: So based on this, you presented recently\\nthis Interplanetary Transport System which is visualized this way. This is a scene you picture in, what,\\n30 years time? 20 years time? People walking into this rocket. EM: I\\'m hopeful it\\'s sort of\\nan eight- to 10-year time frame. Aspirationally, that\\'s our target. Our internal targets\\nare more aggressive, but I think -- (Laughter) CA: OK. EM: While vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparison\\nwith other rockets, I think the future spacecraft will make this look like a rowboat. The future spaceships\\nwill be truly enormous. CA: Why, Elon? Why do we need to build a city on Mars with a million people\\non it in your lifetime, which I think is kind of\\nwhat you\\'ve said you\\'d love to do? EM: I think it\\'s important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning\\nand you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What\\'s the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we\\'re not out there, if the future does not include\\nbeing out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it\\'s incredibly depressing if that\\'s not the future\\nthat we\\'re going to have. (Applause) CA: People want to position this\\nas an either or, that there are so many desperate things\\nhappening on the planet now from climate to poverty\\nto, you know, you pick your issue. And this feels like a distraction. You shouldn\\'t be thinking about this. You should be solving what\\'s here and now. And to be fair, you\\'ve done\\na fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustainable energy. But why not just do that? EM: I think there\\'s -- I look at the future\\nfrom the standpoint of probabilities. It\\'s like a branching\\nstream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can take\\nthat affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing\\nor slow down another thing. I may introduce something new\\nto the probability stream. Sustainable energy\\nwill happen no matter what. If there was no Tesla,\\nif Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity. It\\'s tautological. If you don\\'t have sustainable energy,\\nit means you have unsustainable energy. Eventually you will run out, and the laws of economics\\nwill drive civilization towards sustainable energy, inevitably. The fundamental value\\nof a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates\\nthe advent of sustainable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur. So when I think, like, what is the fundamental good\\nof a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade,\\npotentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thing to occur. That\\'s what I consider to be the fundamental\\naspirational good of Tesla. Then there\\'s becoming a multiplanet\\nspecies and space-faring civilization. This is not inevitable. It\\'s very important to appreciate\\nthis is not inevitable. The sustainable energy future\\nI think is largely inevitable, but being a space-faring civilization\\nis definitely not inevitable. If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 you were able\\nto send somebody to the moon. 1969. Then we had the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle could only\\ntake people to low Earth orbit. Then the Space Shuttle retired, and the United States\\ncould take no one to orbit. So that\\'s the trend. The trend is like down to nothing. People are mistaken when they think that technology\\njust automatically improves. It does not automatically improve. It only improves if a lot of people\\nwork very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think,\\nby itself degrade, actually. You look at great civilizations\\nlike Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that. And then the Romans,\\nthey built these incredible aqueducts. They forgot how to do it. CA: Elon, it almost seems,\\nlistening to you and looking at the different\\nthings you\\'ve done, that you\\'ve got this unique\\ndouble motivation on everything that I find so interesting. One is this desire to work\\nfor humanity\\'s long-term good. The other is the desire\\nto do something exciting. And often it feels like you feel\\nlike you need the one to drive the other. With Tesla, you want\\nto have sustainable energy, so you made these super sexy,\\nexciting cars to do it. Solar energy, we need to get there, so we need to make these beautiful roofs. We haven\\'t even spoken\\nabout your newest thing, which we don\\'t have time to do, but you want to save humanity from bad AI, and so you\\'re going to create\\nthis really cool brain-machine interface to give us all infinite memory\\nand telepathy and so forth. And on Mars, it feels\\nlike what you\\'re saying is, yeah, we need to save humanity and have a backup plan, but also we need to inspire humanity, and this is a way to inspire. EM: I think the value\\nof beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear. I\\'m not trying to be anyone\\'s savior. That is not the -- I\\'m just trying to think about the future and not be sad. (Applause) CA: Beautiful statement. I think everyone here would agree that it is not -- None of this is going\\nto happen inevitably. The fact that in your mind,\\nyou dream this stuff, you dream stuff that no one else\\nwould dare dream, or no one else\\nwould be capable of dreaming at the level of complexity that you do. The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,\\nis a really remarkable thing. Thank you for helping us all\\nto dream a bit bigger. EM: But you\\'ll tell me if it ever\\nstarts getting genuinely insane, right? (Laughter) CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.\\nThat was really, really fantastic. That was really fantastic. (Applause)')]"
